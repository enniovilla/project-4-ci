## User Experience (UX)

### Site Objectives

With the creation of this website I aim to make life easier for clients who want to spend some quiet time in a spa. By booking online, the customer just has to go to our spa and enjoy the time. On the website, customers can also check out all the services we offer.

### User Stories

#### First Time User

* I want to relax.
* I want to disconnect from the world.
* I want to see what kind of services I can find at a spa.
* I want to book a day to go to the spa.

#### Returning User

* I want to check new treatments the spa has to offer.
* I want to contact the establishment.
* I want to sign up and book a date.

#### Frequent User

* I want to book new dates to go back.

## Design

### Website Structure

My plan was much bigger than I really thought I could do. I didn't expect the fourth Code Institute project to be so extensive and complicated, I hope I can deliver and I say that because it's 5 o'clock in the morning, I haven't slept yet and today is my deadline, but that said, you'll see that the final product came out with less content than what I put in the wireframes, but what matters is that I managed to do a cohesive job!

This website consists of a home page, a treatment page, a booking page, a login page, a registration page, a contact page and a page for users to manage their bookings.

### Wireframes

Figma was the software I opted to create the wireframes. I created wireframes for mobile and desktop. Click on the button below to see them.

### Color Scheme

This website has two main colors, `#78C2AD` being the primary and `#FFF5E0` the secondary, in addition to the black color `#000000` as the font color, the top bar above the navigation bar and details. The color `#609C8B` was used to make some hover effects.

Some other singular colors also appear in the project, such as the colors of the standard Bootstrap buttons.

### Flow Diagram

This is a very basic flow diagram about the flow an user and an admin could have when using the website.

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The ERD is pretty simple too, thanks to my bad time management.

### Typography

The font I chose to use was [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) from Google Fonts and as a fall back font, sans-serif.

## Features and Future Features

### Features

This is a multi-page website and all of them are responsive. On each page we have:

- A favicon.<br>
![Zen Oasis Spa favicon](documentation/images/favicon.png)

- A navigation bar with clickable logo and names that will take the user to the home page and the menu with sign up button highlighted to facilitate the user experience. If the user can scroll down, the navigation bar will be fixed at the top of the screen for easy access. There is a top bar on top of the navigation bar with the login navigation source.
![Zen Oasis Spa navbar](documentation/images/navbar.png)

- A footer with social media icons that lead to external pages and to my github page in case you click my name.

### Book Now Page

This page will take you to the login page in case you are not logged in, but in case you are, you are redirected to the booking page. A small detail is that if you are logged in, at the top right of the screen, below the navigation bar, you can see a message "Hello, username" and this message is seen from every page of the website.
![Zen Oasis Spa booking page](documentation/images/booking_page.png)

[Back to top](<#content>)

### Booking Successful Page

The user will be able to see a page with a message informing them the booking was made. This message will also show details about the booking. In case the user cannot make the booking because of date mistakes or something else, he will be notified with an alert and won't be able to proceed.

### Edit & Delete Booking Pages
Whenever the user tries to edit or delete a booking, they will be notified if they succeeded. In case of editing a booking, if there is something wrong, they will also be notified.

Last but not least we have the logout page that takes the user to the home page after successfully logging out

### Future Features

- I would like to have a better booking system, so the user can book singular treatments.
- I would like to have a payment system integrated to the booking system, so the user can pay ahead and don't have to worry about it later.
- I would like to have a fully functional authentication system, where users can recover their passwords and get messages on their emails.

## Credits

- All the features of my website were developed with the guidance of the lessons from the Code Institute's I Think Therefore I Blog project.
- This particular [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9dhCQ7FdD0&t=1410s) made me understand the logic behind reservation systems.
- With [this other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2-JYxnSiB0) I could learn how to render calendars on my html.
- [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/) has become my best friend alongside [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

## Content

- The spa home page text and treatments descriptions were generated by [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/).
- I was having trouble building the booking system, until [Denis](https://github.com/dhardi) shared on Code Institute's Slack that he wanted a review of his project, which although it was another topic, also involved a booking system and although the work wasn't finished, it helped me A LOT.
